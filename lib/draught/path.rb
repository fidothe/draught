module Draught
  # A Path is a representation of a line or shape â€“ a series of points connected
  # by lines or curves.
  #
  # Paths are made up of one or more distinct connected point series. Unlike SVG
  # Paths, Draught Paths can only contain a single set of connected points.
  # Compound paths (paths containing subpaths) are handled separately.
  #
  # A simple straight line is a single subpath with two points. A square is a
  # series of 4 points where the last point connects back to the first
  # ('closed').
  #
  # Paths are immutable, so operations that seem like they modify a path are
  # actually creating a copy of the original path with the modifications.
  #
  # {Path::Builder} provides a DSL for creating paths piecemeal. Once the
  # builder block is finished, the complete Path is returned.
